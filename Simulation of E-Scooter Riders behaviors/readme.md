This project assesses the impact of different strategies for E-Scooter Ride Sharing platform on people who commute through Semei MRT daily. Since to perform the impact assessment physically is time consuming and costly, strategies were tested for effectiveness through a simulation whose distributions were generated from raw data on people's interaction with Simei MRT.

Guide:
1. Refer to "Simei Ridership.xlsx" to view raw data
2. Python codes refers to all the simulations performed
3. Word Doc files shed more context on the topic
